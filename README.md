# Parking System

Parking System is a simple parking management application built using .NET 5. This system allows users to park vehicles, check out, and generate reports on the parking status. The application operates through a console interface without a graphical user interface.

## Key Features

- **Check-In**: Vehicles (Cars and Motorcycles) can enter and use the available lots.
- **Check-Out**: Vehicles can exit, and the parking slot will become available again.
- **Cost Calculation**: Parking fees are calculated on an hourly basis, with a minimum of 1 hour for each vehicle.
- **Reports**: Generate reports on the number of occupied lots, available lots, and vehicle counts based on type, odd/even registration numbers, and color.
